### Hello! Nice to meet you ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm Leonardo and I'm 25 years old. I have a **BSc in Corporate Finance** and currently wrapping up (remotely) my **MSc in Information and Enterprise Systems**  
I have coded in **Python**, **C++**, **C#**, **MATLAB**, **R** and **VBA** *(mostly Python the last 4 years)*.

You can usually find me building solutions that:
* Retrieve and store large amounts of data
* Find patterns and anomalous behaviours
* Optimize or/and automate complex processes

This entangles several different areas of which financial services are my favourite but I'm always keen to learn & develop new skills

(some) topics I recurrently work with:
* Financial Products & Derivatives
* High Performance Databases
* Time Series Forecasting
* Software Architecture
* Machine Learning
* Spectral Analysis
* Econometrics
