### Hello! Nice to meet you!! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

I'm Leonardo and I'm 25 years old. I have a **BSc in Corporate Finance** and currently wrapping up (remotly) my **MSc in Information and Enterprise Systems**. I also did 2 semesters at an **Applied Econometrics and Forecasting MSc**.

I have coded in **Python**, **C++**, **C#**, **MATLAB**, **R** and **VBA** *(mostly Python the last 3 years)*.

Currently based in Portugal, you can usually find me building solutions that:
* Retrieve and store large amounts of data
* Find patterns and anomalous behaviours
* Optimize and/or automate complex processes

This entangles a lot of different areas which financial services are my favourite but I'm always keen to learn & develop new skills!ðŸ˜ƒ

(some) domains I recurrently work with:
* Financial Products & Derivatives
* High Performance Databases
* Time Series Forecasting
* Software Arquitecture
* Machine Learning
* Spectral Analysis
* Econometrics
