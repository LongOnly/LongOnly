### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leonardo and I'm 25 years old. I have a BSc in Corporate Finance and currently wrapping up (remotly) my MSc in Information and Enterprise Systems. I also did 2 semesters at an Applied Econometrics and Forecasting MSc.

I have coded in Python, C++, C#, MATLAB, R and VBA (mostly Python the last 3 years).

Currently based in Portugal, you can usually find me building solutions that:
* Retrieve and store large amounts of data
* Find patterns and anomalous behaviours
* Optimize complex processes
* Automate boring tasks

This entangles a lot of different areas which financial services are my favourite but I'm always keen to learn & develop new skills!

(some) knowledge domains:
* Financial Markets & Asset Management
* Financial Products & Derivatives
* High Performance Databases
* Time Series Forecasting
* Software Arquitecture
* Spectral Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Econometrics
* Databases
